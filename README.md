Naming Conventions
===================

- We usually refer to using the standard naming conventions from this source: [https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming)

- Never repeat resource type names like this `resource "aws_instance" "aws_ec2_instance" {` which makes our code ugly and confusing.

Tools
======
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)
